- Simplestreams
  Simplestreams is a data format, a python client library and a command line
  client to interact with the dataformat.
  - Ubuntu publishes data about downloads and image-ids in simple streams format
  - Juju queries simplestreams data to determine both its downloads and image-ids.

- general overview of simplestreams
  - all json data
  - gpg signatures allow for secure use over insecure transfer (http)
  - designed to be easily mirrored 
    - without race conditions
    - with gpg signatures kept intact
  - generally, all items can have arbitrary "tags" which are key/value pairs
  - some tags have specific meaning ('path')
  - 2 different "format" are defined and used
    - index:1.0
      - indexes other files
      - has 'index' dictionary that is populated with 'content_id's.
    - products:1.0
      - "content_id" : declares where this content is coming from.
         example: "com.ubuntu.cloud:released:download"
      - "products":
         A product is something that acts in an expected way.  Examples of
         a product is "com.ubuntu.cloud:server:11.10:i386"
         or "com.ubuntu.cloud:server:12.04:amd64"
         
         Products have multiple "versions".  Each version should behave
         similarly, essentially promising an ABI of sorts.

         Other examples of a product might be:
           libwhizbang:1.1:ppc64
           python-foolib:1.1

      - "versions"
        Versions allow for updates of a product.  Ubuntu distributes cloud images
        daily or on a 3 week release cadence.
        a "Version" is then something like a YYYYMMDD format, but can be
        anything.  newer versions are those that sort greater in a C-Locale sort.

      - "items"
        Items are things that go with that version.
        Example items for cloud images are -disk1.img and .tar.gz.

- usquery / usmirror
  simple wrapper around sstream-query and sstream-mirror that knows urls

- sstream-mirror
  - filters allow you to filter entries by tags using operators:
     ~, !~, =, !=

  - Example 1:
    ./bin/usmirror --dry-run uc-release luc-release --no-item-download
    ./bin/usmirror uc-release luc-release --no-item-download
    ./bin/usmirror uc-daily luc-daily --no-item-download

  - Example 2: mirror cirros data, show --progress
    ./bin/usquery cirros --pretty --max=1
    ./bin/usquery cirros  --pretty --max=1 stream=released
    tenv ./bin/usmirror cirros arch=amd64 lcirros

- sstream-query

- example-sync / GlanceMirror
  - GlanceMirror mirrors a cloud-image products data into glance.
  - it can publish simplestreams data to swift, which then can be queried
